Thanks for checking out my projects. You can run and build them inside Unity. But be aware that different versions may cause problem. So I have written recommended Unity version in the project name.

Some projects may have a folder named "Builds". That's where I export the builds after finishing the creation of game, and before uploading them to my website.
